There are two numbers the user may enter, the Average Glugose and A1C.
There are two different formulas to calculate between the two, ADAG and DCCT. Therefore, there are four possible formulas.

ADAG:
eAG = (1.583 * A1C - 2.52) * 18.05
A1C = (eAG/28.57315) + 1.59191409

DCCT:
eAG = (A1c * 35.6) - 77.3
A1C = (eAG/35.6) + 2.17134831
